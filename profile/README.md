## What is Degiro App for Desktop?

Degiro App is the official desktop trading application of the Degiro platform, designed to bring a professional-grade trading experience directly to your Windows or macOS computer. It consolidates all the functionality of Degiro’s online platform into a fast, reliable, and highly optimized desktop environment. With the Degiro desktop app, users benefit from lower latency, enhanced security, better system resource utilization, and a more intuitive trading interface than is possible via a web browser.

### Desktop vs. Web Trading

Unlike browser-based trading platforms, Degiro App runs natively on your operating system, which allows it to:  
- Use CPU and memory resources more efficiently for faster updates.  
- Reduce lag in market data refresh and order execution.  
- Provide a stable trading environment free from browser crashes, tab overloads, or memory leaks.  
- Minimize distractions with a dedicated workspace tailored for traders.

   The app allows users to continue reviewing portfolio analytics, market charts, and historical data even if the internet connection is temporarily lost. This ensures uninterrupted trading preparation and analysis.

5. **Customizable Dashboards and Notifications**  
   Traders can tailor their dashboard to track favorite stocks, monitor portfolios, or follow specific indices. Push notifications inform users about market changes, price movements, or trade confirmations, enabling faster response to market events.
